Coded the rock, paper, scissors mini game to determine participant turn
- originally going to use a point to point to the winner of the minigame
	- thought it was a bit overkill as the same could be done with a normal variable to hold the minigame result
- originally was going to have a variable store an exit clause (while participantsDrawed = False)
	- however, realised that returns would automatically end the loop. Meaning that having an exit clause end the while loop THEN return a winner would be redudant.
- ran into the same problem of rand returning the same set of variables each time the program is run

altered the code functionality to have the player or cpu turn activate based in if the respective participant wins
	- because this was a major restructuring of the code, chose to work on this in a branch in order to maintain a backup version incase the alterations broke the code.

also restructed the code to display the player's hand and the discard card at the start of every round
	- if not, you could theoratically lose the entire game without seeing your hand if the cpu wins every time (currently you only see your hand if its your turn)


coded one of the special power up cards - Reveal a Card
- reformatted code to have switch cases check for if a special card is played

NEXT STEPS:

- Save Data
- +2, +4 and wild card
- Intro screen
