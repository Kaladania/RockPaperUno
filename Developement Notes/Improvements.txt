Improvements:
- use the filesystem library to create a function to check if there is save data for a similar name (i.e ask if the player meant "james" instead of "james3" as there is save data for the former)
	- in addition to this, create a password system to protect save data incase somebody uses this check to try/accidentally taint another player's save data

- could alter the layout of the intro code to ask and only make save data WHEN the player wishes to save. Reduces the amount of blank txt files created if the player wisged to exit without saving

restructure the code in a way that doesn't require the player class to be imported JUST to use

now that files are being communicated with, add further checks to the player username to ensure that it doesn't inlcude characters illegal in file names (such as * " / \ < > : | ?)

moreover want to add a function that deletes save data after that specific game has been one 
	- prevents players from milking the same game to boost their records



overall fun game.
have some regrets incorporating rock paper scissors since it extends the gameplay quite a bit
the humor of potentially going 5 or so rounds without a turn turns to annoyance when its revealed the cpu has an uno and you've still got 6 cards left
that being said, the reliance on luck made the final moments of the game more tense as i hoped to win the minigame during round 19 as both myself and the cpu had only one card remaining (i lost)
