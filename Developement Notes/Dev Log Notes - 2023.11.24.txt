Rearranged the solution project in order to better organise code
	- realised that the reason I was having trouble creating additional cpp files was because I had the library inclusions exist with the definitions
		- meant that whenever I tried to include the setup header file to get the libraries, the definitions were also being reincluded, causing errors

	- created a new cpp file to store the code used for the game's intro screen.

- wanted to further restructure the code to have functions in their own header file (to keep up with good practice), but after a discussion with James, decided against that due to the major possibility of things breaking so close to the deadline

Included enums to improve readability

thought about moving the player actions to their own seperate function (i.e lines 88 to 145 in ROCK-PAPER-UNO.cpp would be placed in their own seperate function)
	- however decided against due to the copius amounts of variables being used meaning that alot of parameters would need to be passed into the function
- that being said moved the code to display coloured cards into its own function
	- reduced the amount of repeated code

- decided to allow powerups to be played with both the same number AND the same colour (instead of just the latter) to make the game easier (and move faster)

added QOL improvemets by clarifying if the card revealed or discarded was a power-up card, as well as the colour and letter of the power up card

Creating the intro game screen

Added code to exit from the screen AND the rock, paper, scissors minigame (can exit from all points now)

redid some of the code to group the player variables (i.e name and chosen action) into a struct
	- allows for both the name and player action to be returned from the intro screen to neaten code
